            Paella (pai·ei·uh) is a classic Spanish rice dish made with rice,
            saffron, vegetables, chicken, and seafood cooked and served in one
            pan. Although paella originates from Valencia, it’s recognized as
            the national food of Spain and there are several different
            varieties. The most common types of paella are chicken paella,
            seafood paella, or mixed paella (a combination of seafood, meats,
            and vegetables).

            In Spain, the dish goes by a few different names, including tortilla
            de patatas, tortilla española, or tortilla de papas. (The American
            translation is a Spanish Omelette.) It’s an egg and potato dish
            that’s cooked in a skillet and served as a tapa, a main dish with a
            baguette and green salad, or even enjoyed as a snack.

                  mins. The pan should have lots of crispy, brown bits on the
